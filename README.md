# ðŸ§© About the Project

Welcome to the staging-web branch! This branch is my solution to the [Browser extensions manager UI challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/browser-extension-manager-ui-yNZnOfsMAp). No API calls here â€” this branch is all mock data, straight from what was provided for the challenge. Just had fun building things out with it. Hopefully it helps someone!
