# ðŸ§© About the Project

This project is a Chrome extension that helps you manage your installed Chrome extensions with ease. It originally began as a solution to [Browser extensions manager UI challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/browser-extension-manager-ui-yNZnOfsMAp)â€”you can preview that version via the deployed web app (that uses mock data) [here](https://chrome-extensions-manager.vercel.app/), and if you're interested in the source code, check out the `staging-web` branch in the repository. One of my mentors suggested turning it into a full-fledged Chrome extension... and here we are!

## Quick Access
Donâ€™t feel like messing with Developer Mode?

Just download the [chrome-extensions-manager.zip](https://github.com/CrownedTechie/chrome-extensions-manager/releases/download/v1.0.0/chrome-extensions-manager.zip), unzip it, and follow the *"Load Extension in Chrome"* steps from the Installation section â€” but this time, select the extracted folder. 
Alternatively, you can head over to the [latest release page](https://github.com/CrownedTechie/chrome-extensions-manager/releases/tag/v1.0.0) and follow the steps from there.
